      <h3>Who are we?</h3><br />
      <p>AceEnvy &#9824; is dedicated to sharing free open source web designs online the aim is to bring together the very best web designs on the web and share those designs so that others may benefit and start their own web projects quickly and easily</p><br />
      <h3>Why Us?</h3><br />
      <p>We see thousands of developers each and every day sharing their projects on social media and we also see thousands of developers struggle with designing their own projects as well so we thought we would help by collecting templates and making them free to download we however wont take anyone's designs this is a place that developers can share their design if they want to if you are a developer and want to share your design with us see the Q&A section below thank you</p><br />
      <h3>Q and A's</h3><br />
      <p><b>Q. How Can I share my Design?</b></p><br />
      <p><b>A.</b> You can Submit your design by contacting the owner from the slide out navigation on the bottom preferably by useing Github so She can see your code and fork it.</p><br />
      <p><b>Q. Are the templates realy free?</b></p><br />
      <p><b>A.</b> Yes all the designs are free they are made by us or users who wanted to share there design and gave us permission to use it</p><br />
      <p><b>Q. How will i know who made the design?</b></p><br />
      <p><b>A.</b> Inside of each file is a README.txt file with the owner's name and social links if they want us to add them if you don't see a README.txt then the design was made by us in house</p><br />
      <p><b>Q. Why should i trust you?</b></p><br />
      <p><b>A.</b> All files are eather a ".html" ".css" ".js" and a ".txt" files that we put in a ".zip" file we scan each file for malicious code before we upload them we will never upload files with any other extention like ".php" for example to safeguard our downloads and keep our users safe</p>
